The tutorial will first motivate why NLP+Vis is an important area of research and provide an overview of research topics on combining NLP and Vis techniques. Then an overview of state-of-the-art deep learning models for NLP will be covered. Next, we will provide an overview of applying visualization techniques to help make NLP models more interpretable and explainable. In the final part, we will focus on various application tasks at the intersection of NLP and Vis. We will conclude with an interactive discussion of future challenges for NLP+Vis applications.

Such interaction involves a lot of design choices around models, e.g. the sensitivity of interfaces, the impact of design choice and evaluation questions, etc.This tutorial aims to provide a systematic and up-to-date overview of key considerations and effective approaches for studying human-NLP model interactions. Our tutorial will focus specifically on the scenario where end users \u2013 lay people and domain experts who have access to NLP models but are less familiar with NLP techniques \u2014 use or collaborate with deployed models.Throughout the tutorial, we will use five case studies (on classifier-assisted decision making, machine-aided translation, dialog systems, and prompting) to cover three major themes: (1) how to conduct human-in-the-loop usability evaluations to ensure that models are capable of interacting with humans; (2) how to design user interfaces (UIs) and interaction mechanisms that provide end users with easy access to NLP models; (3) how to learn and improve NLP models through the human interactions. We will use best practices from HCI to ground our discussion, and will highlight current challenges and future directions.",

            "desc": "The progress of natural language processing (NLP) is primarily driven by machine learning that optimizes a system on a large-scale set of task-specific labeled examples. This learning paradigm limits the ability of machines to have the same capabilities as humans in handling new tasks since humans can often solve unseen tasks with a couple of examples accompanied by task instructions. In addition, we may not have a chance to prepare task-specific examples of large-volume for new tasks because we cannot foresee what task needs to be addressed next and how complex to annotate for it. Therefore, task instructions act as a novel and promising resource for supervision. This tutorial targets researchers and practitioners who are interested in AI and ML technologies for NLP generalization in a low-shot scenario. In particular, we will present a diverse thread of instruction-driven NLP studies that try to answer the following questions: (i) What is task instruction? (ii) How is the process of creating datasets and evaluating systems conducted? (iii) How to encode task instructions? (iv) When and why do some instructions work better? (v) What concerns remain in LLM-driven instruction following? We will discuss several lines of frontier research that tackle those challenges and will conclude the tutorial by outlining directions for further investigation.",

Our tutorial is based on a survey we recently wrote that proposes such a typology. We will provide an overview of potential social issues in language generation, including toxicity, social biases, misinformation, factual inconsistency, and privacy violations. Our primary focus will be on how to systematically identify risks, and how eliminate them at various stages of model development, from data collection, to model development, to inference/language generation. Through this tutorial, we aim to equip NLP researchers and engineers with a suite of practical tools for mitigating safety risks from pretrained language generation models.",

It targets natural language processing (NLP) and artificial intelligence (AI) researchers as well as creative writing practitioners who are interested in building systems that are capable of emulating as well as augmenting human creativity. In particular, we will review recent studies on creative language generation both at the sentence level as well as longer forms of text. We will provide the audiences with a holistic view of 1) the importance and challenges of building creative language generation systems; 2) how we incorporate content planning, domain knowledge, and creativity-specific heuristics for different forms of creative language generation such as story, poetry, humor, metaphors, etc 3) how can we build better evaluation methods for creative text generation in standalone as well as interactive settings? In particular, how could the recent advancement of AI shape the future workforce for creativity? We will conclude the tutorial by outlining future research directions in this area.",

The aim of this workshop is three-fold. First, we want to provide pioneering researchers who work on computational methods, evaluation, and large-scale modelling of language change an outlet for disseminating cutting-edge research on topics concerning language change. We particularly support discussion on the evaluation of computational methodologies for uncovering language change. Second, we want to bring together domain experts across disciplines by connecting researchers in historical linguistics with those that develop and test computational methods for detecting semantic change and laws of semantic change; and those that need knowledge (of the occurrence and shape) of language change, for example, in digital humanities and computational social sciences where text mining is applied to diachronic corpora subject to e.g., lexical semantic change. Third, the detection and modelling of language change using diachronic text and text mining raise fundamental theoretical and methodological challenges for future research.",

Additionally, this iteration will target women and nonbinary researchers, the queer community, researchers outside the U.S. and Europe, and neurodiverse researchers in NLP. The full-day event will include a call for abstracts, a combination of invited talks, a panel discussion, oral presentations, and poster sessions. The workshop provides an opportunity for junior members of the community to showcase their work and connect with senior mentors for feedback and career advice. WiNLP also offers recruitment opportunities with leading industrial and academic labs. Most importantly, the workshop provides an accepting space that lowers structural barriers that make it difficult for URGs to join and collaborate with their NLP colleagues. The opportunity to present at the workshop is intended for URGs, and allies are encouraged to attend and support speakers.

The research direction of building interactive learning agents facilitates the possibility of agents to have advanced interactions like taking instructions by being a pragmatic listener, asking for more samples, generating rationales for predictions, interactions to interpret learning dynamics, or even identifying or modifying a new task that can be used towards building effective learning-to-learn mechanisms. In a way, with verbal/non-verbal interactive medium this interdisciplinary field unifies research paradigms of lifelong learning, natural language processing, embodied learning, reinforcement learning, robot learning and multi-modal learning towards building interactive and interpretable AI.",

Bangla, with three decade of research history is still considered a low-resource language in the natural language processing (NLP) and speech community mainly due to the limited and scattered research efforts by individual researchers. These line of sparse works are not highly visible to the international research community.\n\nTherefore, this workshop aims to provide a forum for researchers to share and discuss their ongoing work with the international community. Following the success of prior local editions of the conferences in 2018 and 2019, in this first edition of the workshop, we will focus on Bangla, which is a low-resource language, and assess its current state-of-the-art and discuss strategies to make further progress in both NLP, Speech and multimodal research. Through this workshop, we plan to bring researchers together to come up with frameworks and strategies that can later support to other low-resource languages. This workshop is timely given the continued rise in research projects focusing on low-resource and multilingual studies. We particularly encourage researchers to submit their papers focusing on novel methodologies and resources that help towards the progress of Bangla and other low-resource languages. Novel methodologies include, but are not limited to, zero-shot learning, unsupervised learning, and simple yet effective methods applicable to low-computation scenarios.",
